## 🧠 How It Works

1. When research begins, a structured plan is created covering all aspects of the token
2. The server performs searches across multiple sources for information
3. Search results are stored as resources that can be referenced
4. The research progresses through different sections, with status tracking
5. A comprehensive report is generated covering all aspects of the token

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Some websites block web scraping, so direct content fetching may fail with 403 errors
- Relies on search results which may not always be comprehensive
- Rate limits may apply to search operations
